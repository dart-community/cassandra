///
/// The protocol is big-endian (network byte order).
///
/// Each frame contains a fixed size header (9 bytes) followed by a variable size
/// body. The header is described in Section 2. The content of the body depends
/// on the header opcode value (the body can in particular be empty for some
/// opcode values). The list of allowed opcodes is defined in Section 2.4 and the
/// details of each corresponding message are described Section 4.
///
/// The protocol distinguishes two types of frames: requests and responses. Requests
/// are those frames sent by the client to the server. Responses are those frames sent
/// by the server to the client. Note, however, that the protocol supports server pushes
/// (events) so a response does not necessarily come right after a client request.
///
/// Note to client implementors: client libraries should always assume that the
/// body of a given frame may contain more data than what is described in this
/// document. It will however always be safe to ignore the remainder of the frame
/// body in such cases. The reason is that this may enable extending the protocol
/// with optional features without needing to change the protocol version.
